- Dev: `npm run dev`

## Conventions
- Use arrow functions for React components
- Prefer TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Airbnb ESLint rules
```

---

## üí¨ Effective Communication

### Clear Requests
**‚ùå Vague:**
```
"Fix the bug in the app"
```

**‚úÖ Specific:**
```
"The user login form throws a validation error when email contains '+' character. 
Fix the email validation regex in src/components/LoginForm.tsx"
```

### Providing Context
**Always include:**
- What you're trying to achieve
- Current behavior vs expected behavior
- Relevant file paths
- Error messages (if any)

### Using Examples
```
"Create a React component similar to UserCard.tsx but for displaying products. 
It should show product name, price, and image."
```

---

## ‚ö° Code Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
Use Claude's planning capabilities:
```
"I need to add user authentication. Can you help me plan the implementation?"
```

Claude will break down the task into manageable steps.

### 2. Implementation Phase
Work incrementally:
```
"Let's start with the authentication middleware first"
```

### 3. Review Phase
Ask for code review:
```
"Please review the authentication implementation for security best practices"
```

### Iterative Development Pattern
1. **Describe** the feature/change needed
2. **Review** Claude's plan
3. **Implement** step by step
4. **Test** each component
5. **Refactor** if needed

## ü§ñ Subagents & Specialized Tasks

Claude Code uses specialized subagents for different types of tasks. Understanding when and how to use them maximizes efficiency.

### General-Purpose Agent
**Best for:** Complex searches, multi-step tasks, research

```bash
# When to use:
"Search the entire codebase for authentication patterns and analyze them"
"Find all database connection configurations across the project"
"Research how error handling is implemented throughout the application"

# The general-purpose agent excels at:
- Searching through large codebases
- Finding patterns across multiple files
- Analyzing complex relationships
- Research tasks requiring multiple tool uses
```

### Output Style Setup Agent
**Best for:** Configuring Claude Code's output formatting

```bash
# When to use:
"Configure Claude Code to show more detailed error messages"
"Set up custom output formatting for code reviews"
"Create a custom style for API documentation generation"

# This agent handles:
- Output formatting preferences
- Code display styles
- Error message formatting
- Custom report templates
```

### Status Line Setup Agent
**Best for:** Configuring the Claude Code status line

```bash
# When to use:
"Configure the status line to show current git branch and test status"
"Set up custom status indicators for build status"
"Add project-specific information to the status line"

# This agent manages:
- Status line configuration
- Custom status indicators
- Project information display
- Real-time status updates
```

### Requesting Specific Subagents

```bash
# Explicit subagent requests
"Use the general-purpose agent to find all React components that handle user authentication"
"Have the output-style agent create a custom format for displaying test results"
"Ask the statusline agent to add database connection status to the status bar"
```

### Subagent Best Practices

#### 1. Let Claude Choose Automatically
```bash
# Good: Let Claude decide which agent to use
"Search for all API endpoints and analyze their security implementations"

# Claude will automatically select the best subagent for the task
```

#### 2. Be Specific About Complex Tasks
```bash
# Good: Specific multi-step request
"Find all authentication-related code, analyze the security patterns, and create a comprehensive security audit report"

# This automatically triggers the general-purpose agent for complex analysis
```

#### 3. Use for Configuration Tasks
```bash
# Configuration requests automatically route to appropriate agents
"Set up Claude Code to display more verbose output for debugging"
"Configure the interface to show additional project information"
```
